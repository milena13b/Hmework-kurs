    <pre><i>
    You get a shiver in the dark
    It's raining in the park but meantime
    South of the river you stop and you hold everything
    A band is blowing Dixie double four time
    You feel alright when you hear that music ring
    
    Well, now you step inside but you don't see too many faces
    Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
    Competition in other places
    Oh, but the horns, they're blowing that sound
    Way on down south, way on down south London town

    You check out guitar, George
    He knows all the chords
    Mind it's strictly rhythm
    He doesn't wanna make it cry or sing
    Left-handed old guitar is all he can afford
    When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

    <h1 id="song2">The Doors-People are strange</h1>
    <pre><i>
    People are strange when you're a stranger
    Faces look ugly when you're alone
    Women seem wicked when you're unwanted
    Streets are uneven when you're down

    When you're strange
    Faces come out of the rain
    When you're strange
    No one remembers your name
    When you're strange
    When you're strange
    When you're strange

    People are strange when you're a stranger
    Faces look ugly when you're alone
    Women seem wicked when you're unwanted
    Streets are uneven when you're down

    <h1 id="song3">Imagine Dragons-Deamons</h1>
    <pre><i>
        When the days are cold
        And the cards all fold
        And the saints we see
        Are all made of gold

        When your dreams all fail
        And the ones we hail
        Are the worst of all
        And the blood's run stale
        I want to hide the truth
        
        I want to shelter you
        But with the beast inside
        There's nowhere we can hide
        No matter what we breed
        We still are made of greed
        
        This is my kingdom come
        This is my kingdom come
        When you feel my heat
        Look into my eyes
        It's where my demons hide
        It's where my demons hide
        
        Don't get too close
        It's dark inside
        It's where my demons hide
        It's where my demons hide
