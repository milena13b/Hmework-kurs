                        people to jog, starts a ping-pong craze, creates the smiley, writes bumper stickers and songs,
                        donates to people and meets the president several times. However, this is all irrelevant to
                        Forrest who can only think of his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curran, who has messed up her life.

                        Jonathan Trager and Sara Thomas met while shopping for gloves in New York. Though buying for
                        their respective lovers, the magic was right and a night of Christmas shopping turned into
                        romance. Jon wanted to explore things further but Sara wasn't sure their love was meant to be.
                        They decided to test fate by splitting up and seeing if destiny brought them back together...
                        Many years later, having lost each other that night, both are engaged to be married. Still,
                        neither can shake the need to give fate one last chance to reunite them. Jon enlists the help of
                        his best man to track down the girl he can't forget starting at the store where they met. Sara
                        asks her new age musician fiance for a break before the wedding and, with her best friend in
                        tow, flies from California to New York hoping destiny will bring her soulmate back. Near-misses
                        and classic Shakespearean confusion bring the two close to meeting a number of times but fate
                        will have the final word on whether it was meant to be.

                        Charles Sanford "Charlie" Babbit
                        is a self-centered Los Angeles-based
                        automobile dealer/hustler/bookie who
                        is at war with his own life. Charlie,
                        as a young teenager, used his father's
                        1949 Buick convertible without permission
                        and as a result, he went to jail for two
                        days on account that his father reported
                        it stolen. It is then that Charlie learns
                        that his estranged father died and left him
                        from his last will and testament a huge bed of
                        roses and the car while the remainder will of
                        $3 Million goes into a trust fund to be
                        distributed to someone. Charlie seemed pretty
                        angry by this and decides to look into this
                        matter. It seems as if that "someone" is Raymond,
                        Charlie's unknown brother, an autistic savant who
                        lives in a world of his own, resides at the Walbrook
                        Institute. Charlie then kidnaps Raymond and decides
                        to take him on a lust for life trip to the west coast
                        as a threat to get the $3 Million inheritance.

                        From the heights of notoriety to the depths of depravity, John Forbes Nash, Jr. experienced it
                        all. A mathematical genius, he made an astonishing discovery early in his career and stood on
                        the brink of international acclaim. But the handsome and arrogant Nash soon found himself on a
                        painful and harrowing journey of self-discovery. After many years of struggle, he eventually
                        triumphed over his tragedy, and finally - late in life - received the Nobel Prize.
